# Hello-World

Hey there!

This project is being used for teaching myself how to use GitHub.
My name is Bryce Griffin and I am an MIS student that wants to learn
as many technologies as possible before going off and starting a
career. I hope to create a few projects to put on my resume and show
potential employers what I'm capable of. If you have any suggestions,
ideas or general advice, feel free to put them in here. 

Thanks for stopping by,
Bryce
